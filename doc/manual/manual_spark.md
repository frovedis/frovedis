# FrovedisSparseData 

## NAME

FrovedisSparseData -  A data structure used in modeling the in-memory sparse 
data of frovedis server side at client spark side. 

## SYNOPSIS

import com.nec.frovedis.exrpc.FrovedisSparseData        

### Constructors
FrovedisSparseData (`RDD[Vector]` data)   

### Public Member Functions
Unit load (`RDD[Vector]` data)   
Unit loadcoo (`RDD[Rating]` data)   
Unit debug_print()   
Unit release()    

## DESCRIPTION

FrovedisSparseData is a pseudo sparse structure at client spark side which 
aims to model the frovedis server side sparse data (basically crs matrix). 

Note that the actual sparse data is created at frovedis server side only. 
Spark side FrovedisSparseData contains a proxy handle of the in-memory sparse 
data created at frovedis server, along with number of rows and number of columns 
information.

### Constructor Documentation
#### FrovedisSparseData (`RDD[Vector]` data)   
It accepts a spark-side RDD data of sparse or dense Vector and converts 
it into the frovedis server side sparse data whose proxy along with number 
of rows and number of columns information are stored in the constructed 
FrovedisSparseData object.

For example,  

    // sample input matrix file with elements in a row separated by whitespace
    val data = sc.textFile(input)
    // parsedData: RDD[Vector]
    val parsedData = data.map(s => Vectors.dense(s.split(' ').map(_.toDouble)))
    // conversion of spark data to frovedis side sparse data
    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(parsedData)
 
### Pubic Member Function Documentation

#### Unit load (`RDD[Vector]` data)   
This function can be used to load a spark side sparse data to a frovedis 
server side sparse data (crs matrix). It accepts a spark-side RDD data 
of sparse or dense Vector and converts it into the frovedis server side 
sparse data whose proxy along with number of rows and number of columns 
information are stored in the target FrovedisSparseData object.

For example,  

    // sample input matrix file with elements in a row separated by whitespace
    val data = sc.textFile(input)
    // parsedData: RDD[Vector]
    val parsedData = data.map(s => Vectors.dense(s.split(' ').map(_.toDouble)))

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData() // an empty object
    // conversion of spark data to frovedis side sparse data
    fdata.load(parsedData)
 
#### Unit loadcoo (`RDD[Rating]` data)   
This function can be used to load a spark side Rating matrix (COO data) 
to a frovedis server side sparse data (crs matrix). It accepts a spark-side 
`RDD[Rating]` object and converts it into the frovedis server side 
sparse data whose proxy along with number of rows and number of columns 
information are stored in the target FrovedisSparseData object.

For example,  

    // sample input matrix file with rows of COO triplets (i,j,k)
    val data = sc.textFile(input)
    // ratings: RDD[Rating]
    val ratings = data.map(_.split(',') match { case Array(user, item, rate) =>
                        Rating(user.toInt, item.toInt, rate.toDouble)
                  })

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData() // an empty object
    // conversion of spark coo data to frovedis side sparse (crs) data
    fdata.loadcoo(ratings) 

#### Unit debug_print()  
It prints the contents of the server side sparse data on the server 
side user terminal. It is mainly useful for debugging purpose.

#### Unit release()  
This function can be used to release the existing in-memory data at frovedis 
server side.

## DESCRIPTION
PBLAS is a high-performance scientific library written in Fortran language. It 
provides rich set of functionalities on vectors and matrices. The computation 
loads of these functionalities are parallelized over the available processes 
in a system and the user interfaces of this library is very detailed and complex 
in nature. It requires a strong understanding on each of the input parameters, 
along with some distribution concepts. 

Frovedis provides a wrapper module for some commonly used PBLAS subroutines in 
scientific applications like machine learning algorithms. These wrapper 
interfaces are very simple and user needs not to consider all the detailed 
distribution parameters. Only specifying the target vectors or matrices with 
some other parameters (depending upon need) are fine. At the same time, all the 
use cases of a PBLAS routine can also be performed using Frovedis PBLAS wrapper 
of that routine.

This scala module implements a client-server application, where the spark client 
can send the spark matrix data to frovedis server side in order to create 
blockcyclic matrix at frovedis server and then spark client can request frovedis 
server for any of the supported PBLAS operation on that matrix. When required, 
spark client can request frovedis server to send back the resultant matrix 
and it can then create equivalent spark data (Vector, Matrix, RowMatrix etc., 
see manuals for FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix to spark data conversion).

The individual detailed descriptions can be found in the subsequent sections. 
Please note that the term "inout", used in the below section indicates a 
function argument as both "input" and "output".

### Detailed Description 
#### swap (v1, v2)
__Parameters__  
_v1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (inout)   
_v2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (inout)   

__Purpose__    
It will swap the contents of v1 and v2, 
if they are semantically valid and are of same length.

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.   

#### copy (v1, v2)
__Parameters__   
_v1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (input)   
_v2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (output)   

__Purpose__   
It will copy the contents of v1 in v2 (v2 = v1), 
if they are semantically valid and are of same length.   

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.   

#### scal (v, al)
__Parameters__   
_v_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (inout)   
_al_: A double parameter to specify the value to which the 
input vector needs to be scaled. (input)    

__Purpose__   
It will scale the input vector with the provided "al" value, 
if it is semantically valid. On success, input vector "v" 
would be updated (in-place scaling).   

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.   

#### axpy (v1, v2, al=1.0)
__Parameters__   
_v1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (input)   
_v2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (inout)   
_al_: A double parameter to specify the value to which "v1" 
needs to be scaled (not in-place scaling) [Default: 1.0] (input/optional)   

__Purpose__   
It will solve the expression v2 = al*v1 + v2, if the input vectors are 
semantically valid and are of same length. On success, "v2" will be updated 
with desired result, but "v1" would remain unchanged.   

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.

#### dot (v1, v2)
__Parameters__   
_v1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (input)   
_v2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (input)   

__Purpose__   
It will perform dot product of the input vectors, if they are 
semantically valid and are of same length. Input vectors would not get 
modified during the operation.   

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns the dot product result of the type double.
If any error occurs, it throws an exception.   

#### nrm2 (v)

__Purpose__   
It will calculate the norm of the input vector, if it is semantically valid. 
Input vector would not get modified during the operation.   

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns the norm value of the type double.
If any error occurs, it throws an exception.

#### gemv (m, v1, v2, trans=false, al=1.0, be=0.0)
__Parameters__   
_m_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (input)   
_v1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (input)   
_v2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (inout)   
_trans_: A boolean value to specify whether to transpose "m" or not 
[Default: false] (input/optional)   
_al_: A double type value [Default: 1.0] (input/optional)   
_be_: A double type value [Default: 0.0] (input/optional)   

__Purpose__   
The primary aim of this routine is to perform simple matrix-vector multiplication.   
But it can also be used to perform any of the below operations:  

    (1) v2 = al*m*v1 + be*v2   
    (2) v2 = al*transpose(m)*v1 + be*v2

If trans=false, then expression (1) is solved.
In that case, the size of "v1" must be at least the number of columns in "m" 
and the size of "v2" must be at least the number of rows in "m".   
If trans=true, then expression (2) is solved.
In that case, the size of "v1" must be at least the number of rows in "m" 
and the size of "v2" must be at least the number of columns in "m".   

Since "v2" is used as input-output both, memory must be allocated for this 
vector before calling this routine, even if simple matrix-vector multiplication 
is required. Otherwise, this routine will throw an exception.

For simple matrix-vector multiplication, no need to specify values for the 
input parameters "trans", "al" and "be" (leave them at their default values).

On success, "v2" will be overwritten with the desired output. 
But "m" and "v1" would remain unchanged.   

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.   

#### ger (v1, v2, m, al=1.0)
__Parameters__   
_v1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (input)   
_v2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix with single column (input)   
_m_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)   
_al_: A double type value [Default: 1.0] (input/optional)   

__Purpose__   
The primary aim of this routine is to perform simple vector-vector multiplication 
of the sizes "a" and "b" respectively to form an axb matrix. But it can also be 
used to perform the below operations:   

    m = al*v1*v2' + m

This operation can only be performed if the inputs are semantically valid and 
the size of "v1" is at least the number of rows in matrix "m" and 
the size of "v2" is at least the number of columns in matrix "m".

Since "m" is used as input-output both, memory must be allocated for this 
matrix before calling this routine, even if simple vector-vector multiplication 
is required. Otherwise it will throw an exception.

For simple vector-vector multiplication, no need to specify the value for the
input parameter "al" (leave it at its default value).

On success, "m" will be overwritten with the desired output. 
But "v1" and "v2" will remain unchanged.   

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.   

#### gemm (m1, m2, m3, trans_m1=false, trans_m2=false, al=1.0, be=0.0)
__Parameters__  
_m1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (input)   
_m2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (input)   
_m3_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)   
_trans\_m1_: A boolean value to specify whether to transpose "m1" or not 
[Default: false] (input/optional)   
_trans\_m2_: A boolean value to specify whether to transpose "m2" or not 
[Default: false] (input/optional)   
_al_: A double type value [Default: 1.0] (input/optional)   
_be_: A double type value [Default: 0.0] (input/optional)   

__Purpose__   
The primary aim of this routine is to perform simple matrix-matrix multiplication.   
But it can also be used to perform any of the below operations:

    (1) m3 = al*m1*m2 + be*m3
    (2) m3 = al*transpose(m1)*m2 + be*m3
    (3) m3 = al*m1*transpose(m2) + be*m3
    (4) m3 = al*transpose(m1)*transpose(m2) + be*m3  

(1) will be performed, if both "trans_m1" and "trans_m2" are false.   
(2) will be performed, if trans_m1=true and trans_m2 = false.   
(3) will be performed, if trans_m1=false and trans_m2 = true.   
(4) will be performed, if both "trans_m1" and "trans_m2" are true.   

If we have four variables nrowa, nrowb, ncola, ncolb defined as follows:   

    if(trans_m1) {
      nrowa = number of columns in m1
      ncola = number of rows in m1
    }
    else {
      nrowa = number of rows in m1
      ncola = number of columns in m1
    }

    if(trans_m2) {
      nrowb = number of columns in m2
      ncolb = number of rows in m2
    }
    else {
      nrowb = number of rows in m2
      ncolb = number of columns in m2
    }

Then this function can be executed successfully, if the below conditions are 
all true:

    (a) "ncola" is equal to "nrowb"
    (b) number of rows in "m3" is equal to or greater than "nrowa"
    (b) number of columns in "m3" is equal to or greater than "ncolb"

Since "m3" is used as input-output both, memory must be allocated for this
matrix before calling this routine, even if simple matrix-matrix multiplication
is required. Otherwise it will throw an exception.

For simple matrix-matrix multiplication, no need to specify the value for the
input parameters "trans_m1", "trans_m2", "al", "be" (leave them at their 
default values).

On success, "m3" will be overwritten with the desired output.
But "m1" and "m2" will remain unchanged.

__Return Value__    
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.

#### geadd (m1, m2, trans=false, al=1.0, be=1.0)
__Parameters__  
_m1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (input)  
_m2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)  
_trans_: A boolean value to specify whether to transpose "m1" or not 
[Default: false] (input/optional)  
_al_: A double type value [Default: 1.0] (input/optional)  
_be_: A double type value [Default: 1.0] (input/optional)  

__Purpose__   
The primary aim of this routine is to perform simple matrix-matrix addition.
But it can also be used to perform any of the below operations:

    (1) m2 = al*m1 + be*m2
    (2) m2 = al*transpose(m1) + be*m2

If trans=false, then expression (1) is solved.
In that case, the number of rows and the number of columns in "m1" should be 
equal to the number of rows and the number of columns in "m2" respectively.  
If trans=true, then expression (2) is solved.
In that case, the number of columns and the number of rows in "m1" should be 
equal to the number of rows and the number of columns in "m2" respectively.  

If it is needed to scale the input matrices before the addition, corresponding 
"al" and "be" values can be provided. But for simple matrix-matrix addition, 
no need to specify values for the input parameters "trans", "al" and "be" 
(leave them at their default values).  

On success, "m2" will be overwritten with the desired output.
But "m1" would remain unchanged.

__Return Value__  
On success, it returns nothing. If any error occurs, it throws an exception.

argument as both "input" and "output".

### Detailed Description 
#### getrf (m)
__Parameters__  
_m_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)   

__Purpose__    
It computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N distributed matrix, "m" 
using partial pivoting with row interchanges. 

On successful factorization, matrix "m" is overwritten with the computed 
L and U factors. Along with the return status of native scalapack routine, 
it also returns the proxy address of the node local vector "ipiv" containing 
the pivoting information associated with input matrix "m" in the form of 
GetrfResult. The "ipiv" information will be useful in computation of some 
other routines (like getri, getrs etc.)

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns the object of the type GetrfResult as explained above. 
If any error occurs, it throws an exception explaining cause of the error.   

#### getri (m, ipivPtr)
__Parameters__  
_m_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix  (inout)   
_ipiv_: A long object containing the proxy of the ipiv vector 
(from GetrfResult) (input)     

__Purpose__   
It computes the inverse of a distributed square matrix using the LU 
factorization computed by getrf(). So in order to compute inverse of a matrix, 
first compute it's LU factor (and ipiv information) using getrf() and then 
pass the factored matrix, "m" along with the "ipiv" information to this 
function.

On success, factored matrix "m" is overwritten with the inverse (of the 
matrix which was passed to getrf()) matrix. "ipiv" will be internally 
used by this function and will remain unchanged.

For example,

    val res = ScaLAPACK.getrf(m) // getting LU factorization of "m"
    ScaLAPACK.getri(m,res.ipiv()) // "m" will have inverse of the initial value

__Return Value__  
On success, it returns the exit status of the scalapack routine itself.
If any error occurs, it throws an exception explaining cause of the error.

#### getrs (m1, m2, ipiv, trans=false)
__Parameters__   
_m1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix  (input)   
_m2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix  (inout)   
_ipiv_: A long object containing the proxy of the ipiv vector 
(from GetrfResult) (input)    
_trans_: A boolean value to specify whether to transpose "m1" 
[Default: false] (input/optional)   

__Purpose__   
It solves a real system of distributed linear equations, AX=B with a general 
distributed square matrix (A) using the LU factorization computed by getrf(). 
Thus before calling this function, it is required to obtain the factored matrix 
"m1" (along with "ipiv" information) by calling getrf().

For example,    

    val res = ScaLAPACK.getrf(m1) // getting LU factorization of "m1"
    ScaLAPACK.getrs(m1,m2,res.ipiv()) 

If trans=false, the linear equation AX=B is solved.   
If trans=true, the linear equation transpose(A)X=B (A'X=B) is solved.
 
The matrix "m2" should have number of rows >= the number of rows in "m1" and 
at least 1 column in it.   

On entry, "m2" contains the distributed right-hand-side (B) of the equation and 
on successful exit it is overwritten with the distributed solution matrix (X). 

__Return Value__  
On success, it returns the exit status of the scalapack routine itself.
If any error occurs, it throws an exception explaining cause of the error.  

#### gesv (m1, m2)
__Parameters__   
_m1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)   
_m2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)   

__Purpose__   
It solves a real system of distributed linear equations, AX=B with a general
distributed square matrix, "m1" by computing it's LU factors internally. This 
function internally computes the LU factors and ipiv information using getrf() 
and then solves the equation using getrs(). 

The matrix "m2" should have number of rows >= the number of rows in "m1" and 
at least 1 column in it.   
 
On entry, "m1" contains the distributed left-hand-side square matrix (A), 
"m2" contains the distributed right-hand-side matrix (B) and
on successful exit "m1" is overwritten with it's LU factors, 
"m2" is overwritten with the distributed solution matrix (X). 

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns the exit status of the scalapack routine itself.
If any error occurs, it throws an exception explaining cause of the error.

#### gels (m1, m2, trans=false)
__Parameters__  
_m1_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (input)  
_m2_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)  
_trans_: A boolean value to specify whether to transpose "m1" 
[Default: false] (input/optional)  

__Purpose__  
It solves overdetermined or underdetermined real linear systems involving an 
M-by-N distributed matrix (A) or its transpose, using a QR or LQ factorization 
of (A). It is assumed that distributed matrix (A) has full rank. 

If trans=false and M >= N: 
it finds the least squares solution of an overdetermined system.   
If trans=false and M < N: 
it finds the minimum norm solution of an underdetermined system.   
If trans=true and M >= N: 
it finds the minimum norm solution of an underdetermined system.   
If trans=true and M < N: 
it finds the least squares solution of an overdetermined system.   

The matrix "m2" should have number of rows >= max(M,N) and at least 1 column.    

On entry, "m1" contains the distributed left-hand-side matrix (A) and "m2" 
contains the distributed right-hand-side matrix (B). On successful exit, 
"m1" is overwritten with the QR or LQ factors and "m2" is overwritten with 
the distributed solution matrix (X).  

__Return Value__   
On success, it returns the exit status of the scalapack routine itself.
If any error occurs, it throws an exception explaining cause of the error.   

#### gesvd (m, wantU=false, wantV=false)  
__Parameters__  
_m_: A FrovedisBlockcyclicMatrix (inout)  
_wantU_: A boolean value to specify whether to compute U matrix 
[Default: false] (input)  
_wantV_: A boolean value to specify whether to compute V matrix 
[Default: false] (input)  

__Purpose__  
It computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of an M-by-N distributed 
matrix. 

On entry "m" contains the distributed matrix whose singular values 
are to be computed.   

If wantU = wantV = false, then it computes only the singular values in 
sorted oder, so that sval(i) >= sval(i+1). Otherwise it also computes U 
and/or V (left and right singular vectors respectively) matrices.

On successful exit, the contents of "m" is destroyed (internally used as 
workspace). 

__Return Value__  
On success, it returns the object of the type GesvdResult containing 
the singular values and U and V components (based on the requirement) along 
with the exit status of the native scalapack routine.
If any error occurs, it throws an exception explaining cause of the error.

# LinearRegressionModel 

## NAME

LinearRegressionModel -  A data structure used in modeling the output 
of the frovedis server side linear regression algorithms at client spark side.

## SYNOPSIS

import com.nec.frovedis.mllib.regression.LinearRegressionModel    

### Public Member Functions
Double predict (Vector data)

## DESCRIPTION

LinearRegressionModel models the output of the frovedis linear regression 
algorithms, e.g., linear regression, lasso regression and ridge regression. 
Each of the trainer interfaces of these algorithms aim to optimize an initial 
model and output the same after optimization. 

Note that the actual model with weight parameter etc. is created at frovedis 
server side only. Spark side LinearRegressionModel contains a unique ID 
associated with the frovedis server side model, along with some generic 
information like number of features etc. It simply works like a pointer to 
the in-memory model at frovedis server. 

Any operations, like prediction etc. on a LinearRegressionModel makes a request 
to the frovedis server along with the unique model ID and the actual job is served 
by the frovedis server. For functions which returns some output, the result is sent 
back from frovedis server to the spark client.

### Pubic Member Function Documentation

#### Double predict (Vector data)
This function can be used when prediction is to be made on the trained model 
for a single sample. It returns with the predicted value from the frovedis server. 

#### `RDD[Double]` predict (`RDD[Vector]` data)
This function can be used when prediction is to be made on the trained model 
for more than one samples distributed among spark workers. 

It is performed by all the worker nodes in parallel and on success 
the function returns a `RDD[Double]` object containing the distributed predicted 
values at worker nodes. 

#### LinearRegressionModel LinearRegressionModel.load(String path)

filename stored at frovedis server side at specified location (filename with 
relative/absolute path) as little-endian binary data.
On success, it returns the loaded model.

It prints the contents of the server side model on the server side user terminal. 
It is mainly useful for debugging purpose.

## NAME

Linear Regression - A regression algorithm to predict

\  \  \  \ Int numIter = 1000,

## DESCRIPTION
Linear least squares is the most common formulation for regression problems. 
It is a linear method with the loss function given by the **squared loss**:

    L(w;x,y) := 1/2(wTx-y)^2

Where the vectors x are the training data examples and y are their corresponding 
labels which we want to predict. w is the linear model (also known as weight) 
which uses a single weighted sum of features to make a prediction. The method 
is called linear since it can be expressed as a function of wTx and y. Linear 
regression does not use any regularizer. 

The gradient of the squared loss is: (wTx-y).x     

Frovedis provides implementation of linear regression with two different 
optimizers: (1) stochastic gradient descent with minibatch and (2) LBFGS 
optimizer.

The simplest method to solve optimization problems of the form **min f(w)** 
is gradient descent. Such first-order optimization methods well-suited for 
large-scale and distributed computation. Whereas, L-BFGS is an optimization 
algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods to solve the optimization 
problems of the similar form. 

Like the original BFGS, L-BFGS (Limited Memory BFGS) uses an estimation to 
the inverse Hessian matrix to steer its search through feature space, 
but where BFGS stores a dense nxn approximation to the inverse Hessian 
(n being the number of features in the problem), L-BFGS stores only a few 
vectors that represent the approximation implicitly. L-BFGS often achieves 
rapider convergence compared with other first-order optimization.

This module provides a client-server implementation, where the client 
application is a normal Apache Spark program. Spark has its own mllib providing 
the Linear Regression support. But that algorithm is slower when comparing with 
the equivalent Frovedis algorithm (see frovedis manual for ml/linear_regression) with 
big dataset. Thus in this implementation, a spark client can interact with a frovedis 
server sending the required spark data for training at frovedis side. Spark RDD data 
is converted into frovedis compatible data internally and the spark ML call is linked 
with the respective frovedis ML call to get the job done at frovedis server. 

Spark side call for Linear Regression quickly returns, right after submitting the 
training request to the frovedis server with a dummy LinearRegressionModel object 
containing the model information like number of features etc. with a unique 
model ID for the submitted training request. 

When operations like prediction will be required on the trained model, spark client 
sends the same request to frovedis server on the same model (containing the unique ID) 
and the request is served at frovedis server and output is sent back to the spark client. 

### Detailed Description  
#### LinearRegressionWithSGD.train()

__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[LabeledPoint]` containing spark-side distributed sparse 
training data   
_numIter_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 1000)   
_stepSize_: A double parameter containing the learning rate (Default: 0.01)  
_minibatchFraction_: A double parameter containing the minibatch fraction 
(Default: 1.0)   

__Purpose__  
It trains a linear regression model with stochastic gradient descent with 
minibatch optimizer, but without any regularizer at frovedis server. 
It starts with an initial guess of zeros for the model vector and keeps 
updating the model to minimize the cost function until convergence is achieved 
(default convergence tolerance value is 0.001) or maximum iteration count is 
reached.  

For example,   

    val data = sc.textFile("./sample")
    val parsedData = data.map { line =>
        val parts = line.split(',')
        LabeledPoint(parts(0).toDouble, Vectors.dense(parts(1).split(' ').map(_.toDouble)))
    }
    val splits = parsedData.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 11L)
    val training = splits(0)
    val test = splits(1)
    val tvec = test.map(_.features)

    // training a linear regression model with default parameters using SGD
    val model = LinearRegressionWithSGD.train(training)
    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark side sparse data is converted 
into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse data is 
released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server side 
constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(parsedData) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = LinearRegressionWithSGD.train(fdata) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with a 
LinearRegressionModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like number of features 
etc. But it does not contain any weight values. It simply works like a spark side 
pointer of the actual model at frovedis server side. 
It may be possible that the training is not completed at the frovedis server side even 
though the client spark side train() returns with a pseudo model. 

#### LinearRegressionWithLBFGS.train()

__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[LabeledPoint]` containing spark-side distributed sparse 
training data   
_numIter_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 1000)   
_stepSize_: A double parameter containing the learning rate (Default: 0.01)  
_histSize_: An integer parameter containing the gradient history size 
(Default: 10)   

__Purpose__  
It trains a linear regression model with LBFGS optimizer, but without any 
regularizer at frovedis server. It starts with an initial guess of zeros 
for the model vector and keeps updating the model to minimize the cost function 
until convergence is achieved (default convergence tolerance value is 0.001) 
or maximum iteration count is reached. 

    val data = sc.textFile("./sample")
    val parsedData = data.map { line =>
        val parts = line.split(',')
        LabeledPoint(parts(0).toDouble, Vectors.dense(parts(1).split(' ').map(_.toDouble)))
    }
    val splits = parsedData.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 11L)
    val training = splits(0)
    val test = splits(1)
    val tvec = test.map(_.features)

    // training a linear regression model with default parameters using LBFGS
    val model = LinearRegressionWithLBFGS.train(training)
    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark side sparse data is converted 
into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse data is 
released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server side 
constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(parsedData) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = LinearRegressionWithLBFGS.train(fdata) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with a 
LinearRegressionModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like number of features 
etc. But it does not contain any weight values. It simply works like a spark side

regression uses L1 regularization to address the overfit problem.    

The gradient of the squared loss is: (wTx-y).x

    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark side sparse data is converted 
into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse data is 
released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server side 
constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(parsedData) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = LassoWithSGD.train(fdata) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with a 
LinearRegressionModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like number of features 
etc. But it does not contain any weight values. It simply works like a spark side 
pointer of the actual model at frovedis server side. 
It may be possible that the training is not completed at the frovedis server side even 
though the client spark side train() returns with a pseudo model. 

#### LassoWithLBFGS.train()

__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[LabeledPoint]` containing spark-side distributed sparse 
training data   
_numIter_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 1000)   
_stepSize_: A double parameter containing the learning rate (Default: 0.01)  
_regParam_: A double parameter containing the regularization parameter (
Default: 0.01)  
_histSize_: An integer parameter containing the gradient history size 
(Default: 10)   

__Purpose__  
It trains a linear regression model with LBFGS optimizer and with L1 
regularizer at frovedis server. It starts with an initial guess of zeros 
for the model vector and keeps updating the model to minimize the cost function 
until convergence is achieved (default convergence tolerance value is 0.001) 
or maximum iteration count is reached.  

For example,   

    val data = sc.textFile("./sample")
    val parsedData = data.map { line =>
        val parts = line.split(',')
        LabeledPoint(parts(0).toDouble, Vectors.dense(parts(1).split(' ').map(_.toDouble)))
    }
    val splits = parsedData.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 11L)
    val training = splits(0)
    val test = splits(1)
    val tvec = test.map(_.features)

    // training a linear regression model with default parameters 
    // using LBFGS optimizer and L1 regularizer
    val model = LassoWithLBFGS.train(training)
    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

## DESCRIPTION
Linear least squares is the most common formulation for regression problems. 
It is a linear method with the loss function given by the **squared loss**:

    L(w;x,y) := 1/2(wTx-y)^2

Where the vectors x are the training data examples and y are their corresponding 
labels which we want to predict. w is the linear model (also known as weight) 
which uses a single weighted sum of features to make a prediction. The method 
is called linear since it can be expressed as a function of wTx and y. Ridge 
regression uses L2 regularization to address the overfit problem.    

The gradient of the squared loss is: (wTx-y).x   
The gradient of the regularizer is: w   

Frovedis provides implementation of ridge regression with two different 
optimizers: (1) stochastic gradient descent with minibatch and (2) LBFGS 
optimizer. 

The simplest method to solve optimization problems of the form **min f(w)** 
is gradient descent. Such first-order optimization methods well-suited for 
large-scale and distributed computation. Whereas, L-BFGS is an optimization 
algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods to solve the optimization 
problems of the similar form. 

Like the original BFGS, L-BFGS (Limited Memory BFGS) uses an estimation to 
the inverse Hessian matrix to steer its search through feature space, 
but where BFGS stores a dense nxn approximation to the inverse Hessian 
(n being the number of features in the problem), L-BFGS stores only a few 
vectors that represent the approximation implicitly. L-BFGS often achieves 
rapider convergence compared with other first-order optimization.

This module provides a client-server implementation, where the client 
application is a normal Apache Spark program. Spark has its own mllib providing 
the Ridge Regression support. But that algorithm is slower when comparing with 
the equivalent Frovedis algorithm (see frovedis manual for ml/ridge_regression) with 
big dataset. Thus in this implementation, a spark client can interact with a frovedis 
server sending the required spark data for training at frovedis side. Spark RDD data 
is converted into frovedis compatible data internally and the spark ML call is linked 
with the respective frovedis ML call to get the job done at frovedis server. 

Spark side call for Ridge Regression quickly returns, right after submitting the 
training request to the frovedis server with a dummy LinearRegressionModel object 
containing the model information like number of features etc. with a 
unique model ID for the submitted training request. 

When operations like prediction will be required on the trained model, spark client 
sends the same request to frovedis server on the same model (containing the unique ID) 
and the request is served at frovedis server and output is sent back to the spark client.

## DESCRIPTION

LogisticRegressionModel models the output of the frovedis logistic regression 
algorithm, the trainer interface of which aims to optimize an initial 
model and outputs the same after optimization. 

Note that the actual model with weight parameter etc. is created at frovedis 
server side only. Spark side LogisticRegressionModel contains a unique ID

information like number of features etc. It simply works like a pointer to 
the in-memory model at frovedis server. 

Any operations, like prediction etc. on a LogisticRegressionModel makes a request 
to the frovedis server along with the unique model ID and the actual job is served 
by the frovedis server. For functions which returns some output, the result is sent 
back from frovedis server to the spark client.

### Pubic Member Function Documentation

#### Double predict (Vector data)
This function can be used when prediction is to be made on the trained model 
for a single sample. It returns with the predicted value from the frovedis server. 

#### `RDD[Double]` predict (`RDD[Vector]` data)
This function can be used when prediction is to be made on the trained model 
for more than one samples distributed among spark workers. 

It is performed by all the worker nodes in parallel and on success 
the function returns a `RDD[Double]` object containing the distributed predicted 
values at worker nodes. 

#### LogisticRegressionModel LogisticRegressionModel.load(String path)
This static function is used to load the target model with data in given 
filename stored at frovedis server side at specified location (filename with 
relative/absolute path) as little-endian binary data.
On success, it returns the loaded model.

#### LogisticRegressionModel LogisticRegressionModel.load(SparkContext sc, String path)
This is Spark like static API provided for compatibility with spark code. 
But the "sc" parameter is simply ignored in this case and internally it calls 
the above load() method as "LogisticRegressionModel.load(path)".

#### Unit save(String path)
This function is used to save the target model with given filename. 
Note that the target model is saved at frovedis server side at specified location 
(filename with relative/absolute path) as little-endian binary data.

#### Unit save(SparkContext sc, String path)
This is Spark like API provided for compatibility with spark code. 
But the "sc" parameter is simply ignored in this case and internally it calls 
the above save() method as "save(path)".

#### Unit debug_print()  
It prints the contents of the server side model on the server side user terminal. 
It is mainly useful for debugging purpose.

#### Unit release()  
This function can be used to release the existing in-memory model at frovedis 
server side.

## DESCRIPTION
Classification aims to divide the items into categories. 
The most common classification type is binary classification, where there are 
two categories, usually named positive and negative. Frovedis supports binary 
classification algorithm only. 

Logistic regression is widely used to predict a binary response. 
It is a linear method with the loss function given by the **logistic loss**:  

    L(w;x,y) := log(1 + exp(-ywTx))    

Where the vectors x are the training data examples and y are their corresponding 
labels (Frovedis considers negative response as -1 and positive response as 1, but 
when calling from Spark interface, user should pass 0 for negative response and 
1 for positive response according to the Spark requirement) which we want to 
predict. w is the linear model (also called as weight) which uses a single weighted 
sum of features to make a prediction. Frovedis Logistic Regression supports ZERO, 
L1 and L2 regularization to address the overfit problem. But when calling from 
Spark interface, it supports the default L2 regularization only.    

The gradient of the logistic loss is: -y( 1 - 1 / (1 + exp(-ywTx))).x    
The gradient of the L1 regularizer is: sign(w)     
And The gradient of the L2 regularizer is: w     

For binary classification problems, the algorithm outputs a binary logistic 
regression model. Given a new data point, denoted by x, the model makes 
predictions by applying the logistic function:   

    f(z) := 1 / 1 + exp(-z)  

Where z = wTx. By default (threshold=0.5), if f(wTx) > 0.5, the response is 
positive (1), else the response is negative (0).   

Frovedis provides implementation of logistic regression with two different 
optimizers: (1) stochastic gradient descent with minibatch and (2) LBFGS 
optimizer. 

The simplest method to solve optimization problems of the form **min f(w)** 
is gradient descent. Such first-order optimization methods well-suited for 
large-scale and distributed computation. Whereas, L-BFGS is an optimization 
algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods to solve the optimization 
problems of the similar form. 

Like the original BFGS, L-BFGS (Limited Memory BFGS) uses an estimation to 
the inverse Hessian matrix to steer its search through feature space, 
but where BFGS stores a dense nxn approximation to the inverse Hessian 
(n being the number of features in the problem), L-BFGS stores only a few 
vectors that represent the approximation implicitly. L-BFGS often achieves 
rapider convergence compared with other first-order optimization.

This module provides a client-server implementation, where the client 
application is a normal Apache Spark program. Spark has its own mllib providing

the equivalent Frovedis algorithm (see frovedis manual for ml/logistic_regression) with

server sending the required spark data for training at frovedis side. Spark RDD data 
is converted into frovedis compatible data internally and the spark ML call is linked 
with the respective frovedis ML call to get the job done at frovedis server. 

Spark side call for Logictic Regression quickly returns, right after submitting the 
training request to the frovedis server with a dummy LogicticRegressionModel object 
containing the model information like threshold value etc. with a unique model ID 
for the submitted training request. 

When operations like prediction will be required on the trained model, spark client 
sends the same request to frovedis server on the same model (containing the unique ID) 
and the request is served at frovedis server and output is sent back to the spark client. 

### Detailed Description  

#### LogisticRegressionWithSGD.train()   

__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[LabeledPoint]` containing spark-side distributed sparse 
training data   
_numIter_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 1000)   
_stepSize_: A double parameter containing the learning rate (Default: 0.01)  
_minibatchFraction_: A double parameter containing the minibatch fraction 
(Default: 1.0)   
_regParam_: A double parameter containing the regularization parameter (
Default: 0.01)  

__Purpose__  
It trains a logistic regression model with stochastic gradient descent with 
minibatch optimizer and with default L2 regularizer. It starts with an initial 
guess of zeros for the model vector and keeps updating the model to minimize 
the cost function until convergence is achieved (default convergence tolerance 
value is 0.001) or maximum iteration count is reached. After the training, 
it returns the trained logistic regression model.  

For example,   

    val data = MLUtils.loadLibSVMFile(sc, "./sample")
    val splits = data.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 11L)
    val training = splits(0)
    val test = splits(1)
    val tvec = test.map(_.features)

    // training a logistic regression model with default parameters using SGD
    val model = LogisticRegressionWithSGD.train(training)
    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark side sparse data is converted 
into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse data is 
released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server side 
constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(data) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = LogisticRegressionWithSGD.train(fdata) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with a 
LogisticRegressionModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like threshold (default 
0.5) etc. But it does not contain any weight values. It simply works like a spark 
side pointer of the actual model at frovedis server side. 
It may be possible that the training is not completed at the frovedis server side even 
though the client spark side train() returns with a pseudo model.

    val test = splits(1)
    val tvec = test.map(_.features)

    // training a logistic regression model with default parameters using LBFGS
    val model = LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS.train(training)
    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark side sparse data is converted

# Linear SVM

## DESCRIPTION
Classification aims to divide items into categories. 
The most common classification type is binary classification, where there are 
two categories, usually named positive and negative. Frovedis supports binary 
classification algorithms only. 

The Linear SVM is a standard method for large-scale classification tasks. 
It is a linear method with the loss function given by the **hinge loss**:   

    L(w;x,y) := max{0, 1-ywTx}

Where the vectors x are the training data examples and y are their corresponding 
labels (Frovedis considers negative response as -1 and positive response as 1, but 
when calling from Spark interface, user should pass 0 for negative response and 
1 for positive response according to the Spark requirement) which we want to 
predict. w is the linear model (also known as weight) which uses a 
single weighted sum of features to make a prediction. Linear SVM supports ZERO, 
L1 and L2 regularization to address the overfit problem. But when calling from 
Spark interface, it supports the default L2 regularization only.    

The gradient of the hinge loss is: -y.x, if ywTx < 1, 0 otherwise.    
The gradient of the L1 regularizer is: sign(w)     
And The gradient of the L2 regularizer is: w     

For binary classification problems, the algorithm outputs a binary svm 
model. Given a new data point, denoted by x, the model makes 
predictions based on the value of wTx. 

By default (threshold=0), if wTx >= 0, then the response is positive (1), 
else the response is negative (0).

Frovedis provides implementation of linear SVM with two different 
optimizers: (1) stochastic gradient descent with minibatch and (2) LBFGS 
optimizer. 

The simplest method to solve optimization problems of the form **min f(w)** 
is gradient descent. Such first-order optimization methods well-suited for 
large-scale and distributed computation. Whereas, L-BFGS is an optimization 
algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods to solve the optimization 
problems of the similar form. 

Like the original BFGS, L-BFGS (Limited Memory BFGS) uses an estimation to 
the inverse Hessian matrix to steer its search through feature space, 
but where BFGS stores a dense nxn approximation to the inverse Hessian 
(n being the number of features in the problem), L-BFGS stores only a few 
vectors that represent the approximation implicitly. L-BFGS often achieves 
rapider convergence compared with other first-order optimization.

This module provides a client-server implementation, where the client 
application is a normal Apache Spark program. Spark has its own mllib providing 
the Linear SVM support. But that algorithm is slower when comparing with 
the equivalent Frovedis algorithm (see frovedis manual for ml/linear_svm) with 
big dataset. Thus in this implementation, a spark client can interact with a frovedis 
server sending the required spark data for training at frovedis side. Spark RDD data 
is converted into frovedis compatible data internally and the spark ML call is linked 
with the respective frovedis ML call to get the job done at frovedis server. 

Spark side call for Linear SVM quickly returns, right after submitting the 
training request to the frovedis server with a dummy SVMModel object 
containing the model information like threshold value etc. with a unique model ID 
for the submitted training request. 

When operations like prediction will be required on the trained model, spark client 
sends the same request to frovedis server on the same model (containing the unique ID) 
and the request is served at frovedis server and output is sent back to the spark client. 

### Detailed Description  

#### SVMWithSGD.train()   

__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[LabeledPoint]` containing spark-side distributed sparse 
training data   
_numIter_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 1000)   
_stepSize_: A double parameter containing the learning rate (Default: 0.01)  
_regParam_: A double parameter containing the regularization parameter (
Default: 0.01)  
_minibatchFraction_: A double parameter containing the minibatch fraction 
(Default: 1.0)   

__Purpose__  
It trains an svm model with stochastic gradient descent with 
minibatch optimizer and with default L2 regularizer. It starts with an initial 
guess of zeros for the model vector and keeps updating the model to minimize 
the cost function until convergence is achieved (default convergence tolerance 
value is 0.001) or maximum iteration count is reached. After the training, 
it returns the trained svm model.  

For example,   

    val data = MLUtils.loadLibSVMFile(sc, "./sample")
    val splits = data.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 11L)
    val training = splits(0)
    val test = splits(1)
    val tvec = test.map(_.features)

    // training a svm model with default parameters using SGD
    val model = SVMWithSGD.train(training)
    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark side sparse data is converted 
into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse data is 
released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server side 
constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(data) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = SVMWithSGD.train(fdata) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with an 
SVMModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like threshold (default 
0.0) etc. But it does not contain any weight values. It simply works like a spark 
side pointer of the actual model at frovedis server side. 
It may be possible that the training is not completed at the frovedis server side even 
though the client spark side train() returns with a pseudo model. 

#### SVMWithLBFGS.train()   

__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[LabeledPoint]` containing spark-side distributed sparse 
training data   
_numIter_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 1000)   
_stepSize_: A double parameter containing the learning rate (Default: 0.01)  
_regParam_: A double parameter containing the regularization parameter (
Default: 0.01)  
_histSize_: An integer parameter containing the gradient history size 
(Default: 1.0)   

__Purpose__  
It trains an svm model with LBFGS optimizer and with default 
L2 regularizer. It starts with an initial guess of zeros for the model vector 
and keeps updating the model to minimize the cost function until convergence 
is achieved (default convergence tolerance value is 0.001) or maximum iteration 
count is reached. After the training, it returns the trained svm model. 

For example,   

    val data = MLUtils.loadLibSVMFile(sc, "./sample")
    val splits = data.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 11L)
    val training = splits(0)
    val test = splits(1)
    val tvec = test.map(_.features)

    // training an svm model with default parameters using LBFGS
    val model = SVMWithLBFGS.train(training)
    // cross-validation of the trained model on 20% test data
    model.predict(tvec).collect.foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark side sparse data is converted 
into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse data is 
released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server side 
constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(data) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = SVMWithLBFGS.train(fdata) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with an 
SVMModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like threshold (default 
0.0) etc. But it does not contain any weight values. It simply works like a spark 
side pointer of the actual model at frovedis server side. 
It may be possible that the training is not completed at the frovedis server side even 
though the client spark side train() returns with a pseudo model.

# Matrix Factorization using ALS 

## NAME

Matrix Factorization using ALS - A matrix factorization algorithm commonly 
used for recommender systems.   

## SYNOPSIS

import com.nec.frovedis.mllib.recommendation.ALS    

MatrixFactorizationModel    
ALS.trainImplicit (`RDD[Rating]` data,    
\  \  \  \ Int rank,   
\  \  \  \ Int iterations = 100,   
\  \  \  \ Double lambda = 0.01,  
\  \  \  \ Double alpha = 0.01,   
\  \  \  \ Long seed = 0)      
 
## DESCRIPTION
Collaborative filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. 
These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item 
association matrix. Frovedis currently supports model-based collaborative 
filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of 
latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries. 

Like Apache Spark, Frovedis also uses the alternating least squares (ALS) 
algorithm to learn these latent factors. The algorithm is based on a paper 
“Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets” by Hu, et al.

This module provides a client-server implementation, where the client 
application is a normal Apache Spark program. Spark has its own mllib providing 
the ALS support. But that algorithm is slower when comparing with 
the equivalent Frovedis algorithm (see frovedis manual for ml/als) with 
big dataset. Thus in this implementation, a spark client can interact with a frovedis 
server sending the required spark data for training at frovedis side. Spark RDD data 
is converted into frovedis compatible data internally and the spark ML call is linked 
with the respective frovedis ML call to get the job done at frovedis server. 

Spark side call for ALS.trainImplicit() quickly returns, right after submitting the 
training request to the frovedis server with a dummy MatrixFactorizationModel object 
containing the model information like rank etc. with a unique model ID 
for the submitted training request. 

When operations like prediction will be required on the trained model, spark client 
sends the same request to frovedis server on the same model (containing the unique ID) 
and the request is served at frovedis server and output is sent back to the spark client. 

### Detailed Description 
 
#### ALS.trainImplicit()   
__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[Rating]` containing spark-side distributed rating data       
_rank_: An integer parameter containing the number of latent factors 
(also known as rank)         
_iterations_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 100)   
_lambda_: A double parameter containing the regularization parameter 
(Default: 0.01)     
_alpha_: A double parameter containing the learning rate (Default: 0.01)    
_seed_: A Long parameter containing the seed value to initialize the 
model structures with random values     

__Purpose__  
It trains a MatrixFactorizationModel with alternating least squares (ALS) 
algorithm. It starts with initializing the model structures of the size MxF 
and NxF (where M is the number of users and N is the products in the given 
rating matrix and F is the given rank) with random values and keeps 
updating them until maximum iteration count is reached. After the training, 
it returns the trained MatrixFactorizationModel model.  

For example,   

    // -------- data loading from sample rating (COO) file at Spark side--------
    val data = sc.textFile("./sample")
    val ratings = data.map(_.split(',') match { case Array(user, item, rate) =>
                        Rating(user.toInt, item.toInt, rate.toDouble)
                  })

    // Build the recommendation model using ALS with default parameters
    val model = ALS.trainImplicit(ratings,4)
    println("Rating: " + model.predict(1,2)) // predict the rating for 2nd product by 1st user
    
Note that, inside the trainImplicit() function spark side COO rating data is 
converted into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse 
data is released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server 
side constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData() // an empty object
    fdata.loadcoo(ratings) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = ALS.trainImplicit(fdata,4) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with a 
MatrixFactorizationModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like rank etc. But it 
does not contain any user/product components. It simply works like a spark side 
pointer of the actual model at frovedis server side. 
It may be possible that the training is not completed at the frovedis server side even 
though the client spark side train() returns with a pseudo model.

# kmeans 

## NAME

kmeans - A clustering algorithm commonly used in EDA 
(exploratory data analysis).    

## SYNOPSIS

import com.nec.frovedis.mllib.clustering.KMeans    

KMeansModel    
KMeans.train (`RDD[Vector]` data,    
\  \  \  \ Int k,    
\  \  \  \ Int iterations = 100,   
\  \  \  \ Long seed = 0,   
\  \  \  \ Double epsilon = 0.01)   

## DESCRIPTION
Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem whereby we aim to group subsets 
of entities with one another based on some notion of similarity. 
K-means is one of the most commonly used clustering algorithms that clusters 
the data points into a predefined number of clusters (K).  

This module provides a client-server implementation, where the client 
application is a normal Apache Spark program. Spark has its own mllib providing 
the KMeans support. But that algorithm is slower when comparing with 
the equivalent Frovedis algorithm (see frovedis manual for ml/kmeans) with 
big dataset. Thus in this implementation, a spark client can interact with a frovedis 
server sending the required spark data for training at frovedis side. Spark RDD data 
is converted into frovedis compatible data internally and the spark ML call is linked 
with the respective frovedis ML call to get the job done at frovedis server. 

Spark side call for KMeans.train() quickly returns, right after submitting the 
training request to the frovedis server with a dummy KMeansModel object 
containing the model information like k value etc. with a unique model ID 
for the submitted training request. 

When operations like prediction will be required on the trained model, spark client 
sends the same request to frovedis server on the same model (containing the unique ID) 
and the request is served at frovedis server and output is sent back to the spark client. 

### Detailed Description  

#### KMeans.train()
__Parameters__   
_data_: A `RDD[Vector]` containing spark-side data points    
_k_: An integer parameter containing the number of clusters   
_iterations_: An integer parameter containing the maximum number 
of iteration count (Default: 100)        
_seed_: A long parameter containing the seed value to generate the 
random rows from the given data samples (Default: 0)      
_epsilon_: A double parameter containing the epsilon value (Default: 0.01)      

__Purpose__  
It clusters the given data points into a predefined number (k) of clusters.  
After the successful clustering, it returns the KMeansModel. 

For example,

    // -------- data loading from sample kmeans data file at Spark side--------
    val data = sc.textFile("./sample")
    val parsedData = data.map(s => Vectors.dense(s.split(' ').map(_.toDouble)))
    val splits = parsedData.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 11L)
    val training = splits(0)
    val test = splits(1)

    // Build the cluster using KMeans with default parameters
    val model = KMeans.train(training,2)

    // Evaluate the model on test data
    model.predict(test).foreach(println)

Note that, inside the train() function spark data is converted 
into frovedis side sparse data and after the training, frovedis side sparse data is 
released from the server memory. But if the user needs to store the server side 
constructed sparse data for some other operations, he may also like to pass the 
FrovedisSparseData object as the value of the "data" parameter. In that case, 
the user needs to explicitly release the server side sparse data when it will no 
longer be needed.

For example,

    val fdata = new FrovedisSparseData(parsedData) // manual creation of frovedis sparse data
    val model2 = KMeans.train(fdata,2) // passing frovedis sparse data
    fdata.release() // explicit release of the server side data

__Return Value__  
This is a non-blocking call. The control will return quickly, right after 
submitting the training request at frovedis server side with a 
KMeansModel object containing a unique model ID for the 
training request along with some other general information like k value etc. 
But it does not contain any centroid information. It simply works like a 
spark side pointer of the actual model at frovedis server side. 
It may be possible that the training is not completed at the frovedis server side even 
though the client spark side train() returns with a pseudo model.
